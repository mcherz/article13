# boilerplate

tl;dr: this is a template for a React/Redux app, complete with server-side rendering from a very, very thin Express server. Clone it and make a thing.

@patricko, I'd start here if I were building a React/Redux thing from scratch; for a more complete implementation (and the basis of this), take a look at mcherz/portfolio (which is public).
